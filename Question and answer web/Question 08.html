                    Enhanced user experience: Accessibility features not only benefit people with disabilities but also improve the overall experience for everyone, including:

                    Clear and concise language for users with cognitive disabilities.<br>

                        <p>Increased audience reach: Making your website accessible opens it up to a larger and more diverse audience, potentially boosting engagement and user base.<br>
