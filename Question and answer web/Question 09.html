            <p>Web accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites that are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It ensures equal access to information and functionality for people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, or other impairments, as well as those using assistive technologies like screen readers</p>
            <br>
            <b><u><i>Importance </i></u></b>
            <p class="ex">Provides equal access to the vast resources and opportunities available online for all individuals.<br>
                Many countries have laws and regulations requiring websites to meet accessibility standards.<br>
                Accessibility features not only benefit people with disabilities but also improve the overall experience for everyone, including:
                Easier navigation for users with slow internet connections.<br>
                Clear and concise language for users with cognitive disabilities.<br>
                Compatibility with assistive technologies used by a wider range of individuals.<br>
                Improved SEO as search engines favor accessible websites.</p><br>
                <b><u><i>Key Principles</i></u></b>  
                <p class="ex2"> Content must be presented in a way that can be perceived by users with different sensory abilities.<br>
                  User interface elements must be operable using different input methods, such as keyboards, touchscreens, or voice commands.
                   Information and the user interface must be understandable and meaningful.<br>
                    Content must be robust enough to be compatible with a wide range of assistive technologies.</p><br>
                    <b><u><i>Impact on User Experience</i></u></b>
                    <p>Increased audience reach: Making your website accessible opens it up to a larger and more diverse audience, potentially boosting engagement and user base.
                        Features like clear labeling, keyboard navigation, and alternative text benefit all users, leading to a smoother and more efficient experience.
                       Demonstrating commitment to accessibility showcases inclusivity and social responsibility, positively impacting your brand perception.
                       Meeting accessibility standards helps you avoid legal issues and potential lawsuits</p><br>
                        <b><u><i>Examples </i></u></b>  
                        <p class="ex1"> Screen Readers: Software programs that read aloud the text displayed on the screen, enabling blind or visually impaired users to access digital content.<BR>

                            Voice Commands: Allows users to control devices or software using spoken commands, benefiting individuals with mobility impairments or those who have difficulty using traditional input methods.<BR>
                            
                            Magnification: Allows users to enlarge text, images, and other content on the screen, aiding individuals with low vision.<BR>
                            
                            High Contrast Mode: Increases the contrast between text and background colors, making content easier to read for users with low vision or certain types of color blindness.</p>
